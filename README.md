Project Description: Microservices-Based User Auth & Product Management

This project creates a scalable microservices architecture using Django, Django REST framework, and RabbitMQ. Two microservices handle User Authentication and Product Management independently. JWT ensures secure auth, and RabbitMQ facilitates communication between services. Each microservice has its own database. Test cases validate functionality.
